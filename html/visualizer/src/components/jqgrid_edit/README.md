jqGrid
======

jQuery grid plugin

jqGrid is an Ajax-enabled JavaScript control that provides solutions for 
representing and manipulating tabular data on the web. Since the grid is a 
client-side solution loading data dynamically through Ajax callbacks, it can be
integrated with any server-side technology, including PHP, ASP, Java Servlets, 
JSP, ColdFusion, and Perl.

jqGrid uses a jQuery Java Script Library and is written as plugin for that 
package. For more information on jQuery, please refer to the jQuery web site.
