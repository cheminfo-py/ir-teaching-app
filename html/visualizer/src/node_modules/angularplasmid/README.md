AngularPlasmid
==============

Biological Plasmid Visualization Component using AngularJS

AngularPlasmid is a DNA plasmid visualization component developed using Google's AngularJS 
framework.  The project provides a set of Angular directives to allow for a declarative way 
to contruct a plasmid graph.

Rather than coding client-side Javascript or other server-side programming languages, AngularPlasmid provides
easy-to-use HTML markup, making plasmid generation as easy as creating a web page.  In fact, you don't really neeed to know anything
about AngularJS or Javascript to use the components, as one of the download options bundles everything together for you.
